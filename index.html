                    Record Robotics is a FIRST Robotics team (6731) based in Belmont, Massachusetts. We compete in FIRST regional, district,
                    and world competitions, with students building a robot every year In addition to competing, we participate
                    in the local community organizing outreach events in Belmont year-round. Learn more about our projects

                    leadership, being a team player, and facing challenges, as well as gain experience in fields that will
                    guide them to their future.

                  <p>Our founding students, Sepehr Sokhanvar and Neil Mhatre, wanted a serious engineering project to do over
                    the school year. One day, while playing frisbee, they thought of the idea of creating this robotics team.
                    They founded the team with mentor Saeed Sokhanvar and since then, the team has expanded to around 15
                    core members; all students from Belmont High School. Belmont High School has always strived to create
                    a more rigorous STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) extracurricular program; robotics was
                    the perfect outlet for their respective abilities and talents. The team is primarily driven by students
                    supported with their mentors, who guide and help students in the team, such as engineering, organizing,
                    marketing, and ultimately providing even more learning opportunities for students.</p>

                    At the first competition, we won the Rookie Inspiration award and the highest rookie seed award. Then
                    in our second competition, we achieved the Rookie All-Star award, a award which goes to the highest achieving
                    rookie team in all aspects of the FIRST.</p>

                    In order to boost community outreach and expand our support base we organized an exhibition event at the Beech Street senior
                    center in Belmont. There we demonstrated and explained our robot to any attendees. We allowed many children
                    to take the robot for a spin, maneuvering it through the same obstacles as found in the competition,
                    and let them experience the fun of working with a robot.

                    As the exciting six week build season began, we had to work to strategize the best solutions to the challenges laid out to
                    us in the competition guidelines. After this we began to prototype and design our robot, putting heavy
                    emphasis on following the engineering design process and on design simplicity and functionality. The
                    end result was a successful and well designed robot that went on to see great results in competitions.

                    Town day is a town wide event in Belmont Center that showcases organizations and activities within Belmont. We participated
                    and set up a stand to showcase the work we have been doing. We brought our robot and when people came
                    we explained and showed off all components of our successful robots. Because we know how important it
                    is to reach young children and inspire them to pursue STEM careers, we encouraged young children to drive
                    the robot around and learn from it.

                    We entered ourselves into two competitions, and consequently had to focus on preparing team members for the these events
                    as well as preparing gear and equipment to satisfy the rigorous environment which the competitions foster.

                    This was our first ever competition and though we had yet to get the hang of the whole process and encountered several hitches
                    along the way, we are proud to say that we won two awards:

                        After diving into our competition in Reading, we came in with experience and preparation, fixed up the flaws in our robot,
                        and were ready to win. In each of our matches, we successfully completed all the tasks our robot
                        was designed to do. This resulted in us being picked to compete in the playoffs, and we ended up
                        dominating, beating the other teams with our alliance undefeated, breaking records for points, and
                        winning the competition. We firmly believe this was a result of our dedication and commitment to
                        our mission, and our cooperation with other teams that helped us along the way. Awards won:

                    Continuing with our mission to spread STEM interest in our community, we led a robotics class at the local elementary school
                    (and got to see their old teachers!) We designed an interactive lesson on the Engineering Design Projects.
                    First, the third graders were given different “Design Challenges” for the robots they would be designing
                    in groups - such as one that could clean your room, or play tennis. Students were then taken through
                    the different steps, all while making their own robot prototype designs in groups on paper. They then
                    presented their ideas to the class, and the class voted on the best robot for a prize. In the end, they
                    came out with a lot of fun experience with design and engineering, and learned a lot. We were also able
                    to showcase our robot to them, and they learned how it worked while working on their own projects.

                    FIRST organizes the FIRST Robotics Competition, which our team participates in. The FIRST Robotics Competition consists of
                    a 6 week build period in which teams build a robot to complete a task, followed by a competition period
                    in which teams compete with their robots. This competition has given our team an excellent opportunity
                    to bring together students of different backgrounds and experience together to pursue skills like engineering,
                    programming, business, and technology.
